considered, or the directors, that the person is a trustee for a shareholder who is entitled to vote on the resolution.</p>\n<p>Votes by joint shareholders</p>\n<p>9.3\tIf there are joint shareholders registered in respect of any share,</p>\n<p>any one of the joint shareholders may vote at any meeting, either personally or by proxy, in respect of the share as if that joint shareholder were solely entitled to it, or</p>\n<p>if more than one of the joint shareholders is present at any meeting, personally or by proxy, the joint shareholder present whose name stands first on the central securities register in respect of the share is alone entitled to vote in respect of that share.</p>\n<p>Trustees as joint shareholders</p>\n<p>9.4 Two or more trustees of a shareholder in whose sole name any share is registered are, for the purposes of Article 9.3, deemed to be joint shareholders.</p>\n<p>Representative of a corporate shareholder</p>\n<p>9.5 If a corporation that is not a subsidiary of

exercise if it were a shareholder who is an individual, including, without limitation, the right to appoint a proxy holder, and</p>\n<p>the representative, if present at the meeting, is to be counted for the purpose of forming a quorum and is deemed to be a shareholder present in person at the meeting.</p>\n<p>Proxy provisions do not apply to all companies</p>\n<p>9.6 Articles 9.7 to 9.13 do not apply to the Company if and for so long as it is a public company or a pre-existing reporting company.</p>\n<p>Appointment of proxy holder</p>\n<p>9.7 Every shareholder of the Company, including a corporation that is a shareholder but not a subsidiary of the Company, entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders of the Company may, by proxy, appoint a proxy holder to attend and act at the meeting in the manner, to the extent and with the powers conferred by the proxy.</p>\n<p>Alternate proxy holders</p>\n<p>9.8\tA shareholder may appoint one or more alternate proxy holders to act in the place of an absent proxy holder.</p>\n<p>When proxy holder need not be shareholder</p>\n<p>9.9\tA person must not be appointed as a proxy holder unless the person is a shareholder, although a person who is not a shareholder may be appointed as a proxy holder if</p>\n<p>the person appointing the proxy holder is a corporation or a representative of a corporation appointed under Article

person or by proxy at and entitled to vote at the meeting for which the proxy holder is to be appointed, by a resolution on which the proxy holder is not entitled to vote but in respect of which the
