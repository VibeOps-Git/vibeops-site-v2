# ULTRA-MINIMAL requirements.txt for Vercel (guaranteed under 250MB)
# Only essential libraries - remove EVERYTHING else first

# Basic web utilities only
requests==2.31.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
Flask==3.0.2
authlib

# IF database is absolutely critical, uncomment ONE of these:
# psycopg2-binary==2.9.9    # PostgreSQL (40MB)
# sqlite3 is built-in to Python - use this instead if possible

# NO data processing libraries initially
# NO plotting libraries initially  
# NO ML/AI libraries initially

# Once this deploys successfully, add ONE library at a time
# to find which specific library is causing the 250MB breach
